      <p>
        Humans are composed of thousands of arteries that distribute supplies and
        information to every single cell. These uncountable processes take place in
        every being that habitats this world. It makes it even more surprising that
        the structures humanity created seem so similar to its bodies. In some
        aspects, it could not be in more excellent contrast to
        <button onclick="myFunction()">the natural system.</button></p>

        All of these mechanisms are fascinating and happen on many levels. As the
        most elaborate examples of Infrastructure, cities illustrate the complexity of
        dependencies in the best way. That is probably why city-builders video
        games are my favourite kind. To win, one tries optimizing profit and
        development of their settlement. The always apparent struggle between
        earning and achieving personal goals never leaves the player.</br></br>

        Flourishing in the game means keeping the attractiveness of the city high.
        Increasing the level of security and finding employment are some of the
        main factors in achieving that. As one builds and tries to keep everybody
        happy, realizes one thing - it becomes visible where the poorer or less
        educated population lives. It does not make sense to invest there. One
        maintains the status quo - no profit means losing - and struggling with
        meeting the wealthy citizens' needs is already hard.</br></br>

        Unfortunately, playing on and taking the role of God's hand, one observes
        that people's reality is becoming grimmer and grimmer. They are just
        another number when deciding where to put the next school or a bus stop.
        Somebody has to be left out; it is impossible to make everybody happy. The
        sad actuality is that in the game where one can stop time and carefully
        consider the best solution, most players imitate the cold decision-making
        process known to us from the real world.</p>

      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <h2>"infrastructure
        /ˈɪnfrəstrʌktʃə/
        noun
        the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g.,
        buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or
        enterprise."</h2>
      <p>
        According to this definition by the Oxford Dictionary, the specific elements
        of this vast system seem to be enormous and far away from an individual's
        everyday life. However, that is a deceptive idea - Infrastructure is part of our
        lives in many more moments than we realize.</br></br>
        "(...)the physical components of interrelated systems providing
        commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal
        living conditions" as Jeffrey Fulmer described Infrastructure, again,
        suggests that the phenomenon is enormous.</br></br>
        Nevertheless, if one starts looking at their everyday activities, they shall
        observe that its small components are all around: the sidewalk that takes
        them to school, sewage that follows the road, a bus stop, high voltage lines,
        and a bike lane.</br></br>
        Fulmer's definition provides a closer idea of what the infrastructural mesh
        of elements is supposed to do - provide for society. Whether it is providing
        services or enabling the population to move around attending their
        business, one thing is exact - it is for people. When humanity outlived the
        small community lives a long time ago at 7500 BCE starting the first cities,
        humankind also realized the need for structures to order functioning of the
        significant settlements.</br></br>
        As none of the first civilizations managed to make all their decisions
        collectively, citizens gave up that power to their representatives. Humanitycannot agree on something quickly and efficiently. The domineering system
        used to be a monarchy - the regime rule of an individual, but with time most
        of the planet managed to work out some form of rule of many - democracy.
        None of the ruling systems is, of course, free of flaws but made us remain on
        this planet for the past couple of centuries.</br></br>
        Depending on where one lives, the components of Infrastructure can be
        more or less obvious. In the city, it is easier to point them out as they mostly
        appear in large quantities. There seems to be little of them in areas with
        lower residential density, but that might be deceiving. It is also easier for
        some people to focus on the working ones or maybe the opposite - not
        working, or even worse - non-existent.</br></br>
        It appears evident that inadequate Infrastructure or a lack of it would be
        quickly associated with poor and remote areas. Many socio-economic and
        spatial factors define it. It is tough to describe them all, but the most
        interesting are the ones that connect economic status, demographics, and
        how they influence the community.</br></br>
        One of the biggest problems caused by inefficient and poorly planned
        Infrastructure is creating a disadvantage, total restrain of accessibility, and
        constitutional inequality of opportunity. Following professor Tomasz
        Komornicki's statement in an interview for Interia, this problem does not
        have a simple solution. Following utopian visions of public transportation
        accessible to everyone, everywhere, and at any given time is nonsense and
        not what society needs.</br></br>
        In the interview about the state of transportation infrastructure in Poland,
        he replies to one of the questions in the following manner (please, find
        English translation below):</br></br></p>
      <h2>"Musimy patrzeć, kto i w jakim zakresie będzie z tego transportu
        korzystał. Istnieją takie grupy społeczne, które są w sposób szczególny
        narażone na wykluczenie komunikacyjne. To są te osoby, które z jakiś
        powodów nie korzystają, czy też nie mogą korzystać z transportu
        indywidualnego.(...)</br></br>
        Przykładem jest bardzo istotna grupa młodzieży
        licealnej. Gmina musi zapewnić dojazd do szkoły dla uczniów do
        zakończenia szkoły podstawowej.(...) Jednocześnie szkoła średnia jest już
        zwykle dużo bardziej oddalona i dotarcie do niej pieszo lub rowerem nie
        jest oczywiste. Co więcej te osoby chciałyby pojechać do miasta
        powiatowego nie tylko w godzinach szkolnych, ale także np. wieczorem...</br></br>
        Drugą grupą zagrożona są ludzie starsi, w szczególności kobiety, wdowy,
        których transport oparty był na samochodzie prowadzonym przez męża i
        ta możliwość wraz ze śmiercią, lub niepełnosprawnością małżonka nagle
        się urwała."
        </br></br>
        "We have to look at who will use this transport and to what extent. There
        are social groups that are particularly vulnerable to communication
        exclusion. These are the people who, for some reason, do not use or cannot
        use individual transport (...). </br></br>
        An example is a significant group of high
        school students. The commune must ensure transport to school for pupils
        until the end of primary school (...). At the same time, secondary school is
        usually much more distant, and reaching it on foot or bike is not always
        possible. Moreover, these people would like to go to the poviat town not
        only during school hours but also, e.g., in the evening... </br></br>
        The second group
        at risk are elderly people, in particular women, widows, whose transport
        was based on a car driven by their husband, and this possibility suddenly
        ceased with the death or disability of the spouse."</h2>
      <p>Moreover, to solve those problems possible, there needs to be Infrastructure
        allowing public transportation to function efficiently. It ought to meet the
        demand of the unprivileged side of the society and make it available to
        access all necessary facilities like schools, shops, or service points. The logic
        behind a well working system is to fill in the gaps existing because of money
        deficiency. That opens not only educational but also financial opportunities
        in the shape of making commuting to a more suitable school or better-paid
        job possible.</br></br>
        Looking for a solution is not as easy as many factors influence it. Many, such
        as the social-democratic EU parties, argue that the governments should
        provide means that would fight those negatives. On the other hand, it seems impossible to do so in a capitalist world without engaging the private
        sector and everything-ruling corporations.</br></br>
        Why is trying to find better solutions to that problem so important? This
        paragraph from UN's The Infrastructure – Inequality – Resilience Nexus
        summarizes it pretty well:</p>
