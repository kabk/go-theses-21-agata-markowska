      <p>
        Humans are composed of thousands of arteries that distribute supplies and
        information to every single cell. These uncountable processes take place in
        every being that habitats this world. It makes it even more surprising that
        the structures humanity created seem so similar to its bodies. In some
        aspects, it could not be in more excellent contrast to

        All of these mechanisms are fascinating and happen on many levels. As the
        most elaborate examples of Infrastructure, cities illustrate the complexity of
        dependencies in the best way. That is probably why city-builders video
        games are my favourite kind. To win, one tries optimizing profit and
        development of their settlement. The always apparent struggle between
        earning and achieving personal goals never leaves the player.</br></br>

        Flourishing in the game means keeping the attractiveness of the city high.
        Increasing the level of security and finding employment are some of the
        main factors in achieving that. As one builds and tries to keep everybody
        happy, realizes one thing - it becomes visible where the poorer or less
        educated population lives. It does not make sense to invest there. One
        maintains the status quo - no profit means losing - and struggling with
        meeting the wealthy citizens' needs is already hard.</br></br>

        Unfortunately, playing on and taking the role of God's hand, one observes
        that people's reality is becoming grimmer and grimmer. They are just
        another number when deciding where to put the next school or a bus stop.
        Somebody has to be left out; it is impossible to make everybody happy. The
        sad actuality is that in the game where one can stop time and carefully
        consider the best solution, most players imitate the cold decision-making
        process known to us from the real world.</p>

      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <h2>"infrastructure
        /ˈɪnfrəstrʌktʃə/
        noun
        the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g.,
        buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or
        enterprise."</h2>
      <p>
        According to this definition by the Oxford Dictionary, the specific elements
        of this vast system seem to be enormous and far away from an individual's
        everyday life. However, that is a deceptive idea - Infrastructure is part of our
        lives in many more moments than we realize.</br></br></p>
      <h2>"(...)the physical components of interrelated systems providing
        commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal
        living conditions"</h2>
      <p>as Jeffrey Fulmer described Infrastructure, again,
        suggests that the phenomenon is enormous.</br></br>
        Nevertheless, if one starts looking at their everyday activities, they shall
        observe that its small components are all around: the sidewalk that takes
        them to school, sewage that follows the road, a bus stop, high voltage lines,
        and a bike lane.</br></br>
        Fulmer's definition provides a closer idea of what the infrastructural mesh
        of elements is supposed to do - provide for society. Whether it is providing
        services or enabling the population to move around attending their
        business, one thing is exact - it is for people. When humanity outlived the
        small community lives a long time ago at 7500 BCE starting the first cities,
        humankind also realized the need for structures to order functioning of the
        significant settlements.</br></br>
        As none of the first civilizations managed to make all their decisions
        collectively, citizens gave up that power to their representatives. Humanitycannot agree on something quickly and efficiently. The domineering system
        used to be a monarchy - the regime rule of an individual, but with time most
        of the planet managed to work out some form of rule of many - democracy.
        None of the ruling systems is, of course, free of flaws but made us remain on
        this planet for the past couple of centuries.</br></br>
        Depending on where one lives, the components of Infrastructure can be
        more or less obvious. In the city, it is easier to point them out as they mostly
        appear in large quantities. There seems to be little of them in areas with
        lower residential density, but that might be deceiving. It is also easier for
        some people to focus on the working ones or maybe the opposite - not
        working, or even worse - non-existent.</br></br>
        It appears evident that inadequate Infrastructure or a lack of it would be
        quickly associated with poor and remote areas. Many socio-economic and
        spatial factors define it. It is tough to describe them all, but the most
        interesting are the ones that connect economic status, demographics, and
        how they influence the community.</br></br>
        One of the biggest problems caused by inefficient and poorly planned
        Infrastructure is creating a disadvantage, total restrain of accessibility, and
        constitutional inequality of opportunity. Following professor Tomasz
        Komornicki's statement in an interview for Interia, this problem does not
        have a simple solution. Following utopian visions of public transportation
        accessible to everyone, everywhere, and at any given time is nonsense and
        not what society needs.</br></br>
        In the interview about the state of transportation infrastructure in Poland,
        he replies to one of the questions in the following manner (please, find
        English translation below):</br></br></p>
      <h2>"Musimy patrzeć, kto i w jakim zakresie będzie z tego transportu
        korzystał. Istnieją takie grupy społeczne, które są w sposób szczególny
        narażone na wykluczenie komunikacyjne. To są te osoby, które z jakiś
        powodów nie korzystają, czy też nie mogą korzystać z transportu
        indywidualnego.(...)</br></br>
        Przykładem jest bardzo istotna grupa młodzieży
        licealnej. Gmina musi zapewnić dojazd do szkoły dla uczniów do
        zakończenia szkoły podstawowej.(...) Jednocześnie szkoła średnia jest już
        zwykle dużo bardziej oddalona i dotarcie do niej pieszo lub rowerem nie
        jest oczywiste. Co więcej te osoby chciałyby pojechać do miasta
        powiatowego nie tylko w godzinach szkolnych, ale także np. wieczorem...</br></br>
        Drugą grupą zagrożona są ludzie starsi, w szczególności kobiety, wdowy,
        których transport oparty był na samochodzie prowadzonym przez męża i
        ta możliwość wraz ze śmiercią, lub niepełnosprawnością małżonka nagle
        się urwała."
        </br></br>
        "We have to look at who will use this transport and to what extent. There
        are social groups that are particularly vulnerable to communication
        exclusion. These are the people who, for some reason, do not use or cannot
        use individual transport (...). </br></br>
        An example is a significant group of high
        school students. The commune must ensure transport to school for pupils
        until the end of primary school (...). At the same time, secondary school is
        usually much more distant, and reaching it on foot or bike is not always
        possible. Moreover, these people would like to go to the poviat town not
        only during school hours but also, e.g., in the evening... </br></br>
        The second group
        at risk are elderly people, in particular women, widows, whose transport
        was based on a car driven by their husband, and this possibility suddenly
        ceased with the death or disability of the spouse."</h2>
      <p>Moreover, to solve those problems possible, there needs to be Infrastructure
        allowing public transportation to function efficiently. It ought to meet the
        demand of the unprivileged side of the society and make it available to
        access all necessary facilities like schools, shops, or service points. The logic
        behind a well working system is to fill in the gaps existing because of money
        deficiency. That opens not only educational but also financial opportunities
        in the shape of making commuting to a more suitable school or better-paid
        job possible.</br></br>
        Looking for a solution is not as easy as many factors influence it. Many, such
        as the social-democratic EU parties, argue that the governments should
        provide means that would fight those negatives. On the other hand, it seems
        impossible to do so in a capitalist world without engaging the private
        sector and everything-ruling corporations.</br></br>
        Why is trying to find better solutions to that problem so important? This
        paragraph from UN's The Infrastructure – Inequality – Resilience Nexus
        summarizes it pretty well:</p>
      <h2>"Infrastructure affects inequality of outcomes and opportunities through three
        main channels. First, Infrastructure that provides basic services such as water,
        sanitation, and electricity may affect inequality depending on the quality,
        design, coverage, accessibility, and distribution of that Infrastructure.
        Infrastructure such as irrigation, electricity, ICT, and roads increase
        productivity and reduce trade costs, which affects the structural dynamics
        of the economy,
        including levels of income and distribution of jobs, and may have an effect
        on inequality. The third channel is through connectivity infrastructures such
        as roads and ICT, which affects the access of people to goods, services,
        and job
        opportunities, and therefore may have an effect on inequality."</h2>
      <p>So inequality of opportunity caused by the scarce Infrastructure can cause
        entire populations to polarise, therefore causing disturbance not only in the
        lives of individuals but entire countries. In his book 21 Lesson for 21 Century,
        Yuval
        Noah Harari argues that unrest in the unsatisfied parts of the population
        that feel neglected by the in power personas cause a lot of contemporary politics'
        significant events.</br></br>

        An excellent example of that would be elections in the US in 2016 and Donald Trump's
        success in becoming the president. In the same year, in September of that year, right
         before the voting, Richard V. Reeves wrote for Bookings:
      </p>
      <h2>"Trump is not interested in reducing inequality. But it seems as if much of his
        support is coming from people who feel like they are falling behind and are looking
        for someone to blame: immigrants, "crooked" politicians, welfare recipients.
        They know Trump is extreme and a volatile anti-politician. It is not his ideas that
         attract them, it is his identity.
        These are people who feel that the technocratic, rationalist elite has created a
        world that is amazing for themselves but much less awesome for everyone else. The
        hard part is that, however much we may dislike its expression, there is more
        than a kernel of truth here."
      </h2>
      <p>
        So following Harari again, many people felt left out and neglected by the system.
        According to Bloomberg's report on that election, Trump voters fit one or more of
        the following characteristics: male, white, middle-aged, older, low-income
        citizens.</br></br>

        Another reason for the deep divisions in American society can be pledged to the
        redlining phenomenon that was common and legal till 1968. It was a systematic
        denial of services or goods to people of minorities. As Mitch Mc Ewen argues in her
        article "Another Architecture" its influence was negative on society's already
        discriminated parts and enforced segregation. Not only based on race or appearance
        but also later that created enclaves of people of similar beliefs. That would
        easily encourage the strengthening of radical ideas within communities.</br></br>

        Then again Bloomberg’s report points out that members of these social groups felt
         particularly mistreated by the Democratic party. Although experiencing hardships,
         they were not the target receivers for any of the social programs. Mr Herrari
        thinks that could have been avoided by not branding the social programs as focusing
        exclusively on minorities, but would the organization gain as much politically? That
         question remains.</br></br>
        The story of Verband der Automobilindustrie pressuring the German government and its
        influence on Infrastructure is another one that gives a good understanding. VDA, as
        it is called otherwise, is a lobby group for German carmakers. Its
        persuasive power on the lawmakers comes from the fact that the automotive industry
        is the one that generates one of the most significant revenues and employs around
        830,000 citizens.</br></br>

        Because of that, it is widely accepted that its members are involved in decision
        making on all levels of German politics - from European Union sanctions to building
        a bridge in the right place. It has been confirmed that politicians with ties
        to VDA stopped new environmental restrictions or law proposals like lowering speed
        limits on Autobahn in 1995 and diplomatically smoothing the consequences for
        Volkswagen for breaking EU emission regulations in 2015.</br></br>

        Unfortunately, all of those examples discussed so far create the Perpetuum mobile
        of today's infrastructure problems. Therefore, the profitable one created by
        commerce gives it more influence, and the needed but unprofitable one is created
        only when there is an apparent political gain visible. As an excellent example of
        that, I can give my own country described by Olga Gitkiewicz from her book about
        communication exclusion in Poland:</br></br>
      </p>
      <h2>"Ale kolej ma jeszcze drugą naturę: jest polityczna, jednak politycy jeżdżą
        nią tylko wtedy, kiedy uruchamia się nową linię i kiedy można pokazać się w lokalnych
        mediach."</h2>
      <h2>"But the railroad has a second nature: it is political, but politicians only
        ride it when a new line is launched and when you can appear in the local media."</h2>

    </div>
    <div id="chapter1">
      <h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
      <h2>"(...)as positive social equality that grants all humans the opportunity to shape
        their destinies in the most healthy and communally productive way can only be a
        complete reality when our world is no longer racist and sexist."</h2>
      <p>Firstly an example that seems to marry insufficient Infrastructure with a lack of
        essential service. Firstly an example that might seem to be more about the lack of
        service rather than Infrastructure. It is a story of racism accompanied by
        tremendous inequality that has laid the ground for interracial and social class
        conflict and made it even worse as a final result.</br></br>

        In the 1960s and 1970s, in the USA black population as a whole, but specifically
        black men had a problem influencing their entire community. To picture it, we will
        explore a story that is the best archived - Pittsburgh's Hill District's
        precedent and its Freedom House Ambulance Service.</br></br>

        The Hill, as a district of the city, had a bad reputation. There was a considerable
        unemployment problem, which made drug and alcohol addiction worse than it was before.
        Many men, not only stigmatized by the previously mentioned inclinations,
        had a hard time finding reliable jobs due to broader economic issues influencing the
        entire United States. Most of them did not have a steady income and struggled because
        of that. When they found a more substantial employment form, it was
        often in public institutions working as janitors or fulfilling ungrateful and
        straightforward tasks.</br></br>
        Moreover, most of the men were in disadvantageous positions in getting jobs because
        of their race, and the white population of the United States had broadly kept their
        racist sentiments, at least at that time. After racial segregation became
        outlawed in 1964, it took much more time for society to adjust to new fair social
        norms.</br></br>

        However, this problem for at least some of them got fixed by another problem - lack
        of specific Infrastructure. Furthermore, ironically, it was not felt only in the Hill
        district but in the entire Pittsburgh area - lack of sufficient
        transportation for people in medical needs. </br></br>

        Hospitals and clinics were in place to help cure the population. There was only one
        issue: to save someone's life, that person needed to be near the doctor. The biggest
        problem was getting people in urgent need of medical assistance -
        participants of a road or domestic accidents, people with gunshot wounds, and people
        with a heart attack - into the institutions' proximity. </br></br>

        According to professor Komornicki, this could be fixed in two ways - depending on what
        is more advantageous financially. One can bring the needed institutions and services
        to people in need - in this case, build more hospitals, but the second
        solution seems to be more successful - to organize infrastructural connections that
        bring people to central points of the community that provides the mentioned above
        utilities. It is deemed more beneficial not only financially but also more
        efficiently, as a bigger hospital can employ a wider variety of specialists and provide
        a higher level of service.</br></br>

        The Pittsburg case might seem a problem with a straightforward solution. Why not
        bring patients to the hospital by a very well known means of transportation -
        an ambulance? The answer is simple - at that time in history, no such thing
        existed. Their family members mostly brought people in or, if the patient was picked
        up from a public place, then the police or fire department did it. </br></br>

        That presented a few problems because if one did not own a car, then relatives would
        have to call the police if the accident happened at home. That created many delays
        and also made the police force busy with cases that were not their domain.
        Policemen complained about this and about having no knowledge or training; therefore,
        the whole operation was always terribly scary. There was no luxury like the smart
        modern equipment available now like the Automated External Defibrillator
        to help an inexperienced person save lives. That caused a huge psychological burden
        on the policemen, but that aspect was taken lightly by the deputies. </br></br>
      </p>
          <img src="4.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>This picture is a scarce image presenting two African American Police Officers from
        the City of Pittsburgh Police. Its unique character is connected with the fact that
        these are among the first ones to join the force as the police recruited
        black men more broadly only after 1964 and changes that came with the Civil Rights Act.</h3>
      <p>
        Another thing that needed attention and got none were the police vehicles that served
        as transportation for patients. To some, it might appear as a comfortable way to move
        around. However, one must imagine themselves with a heart attack on
        the back seat of it, alone, because the police officers by protocol should remain
        seated at the front, speeding through the streets with no seatbelts struggling to
        remain alive while being saved. A heart attack remains one of the least
        extreme examples of police transport missions.

        Indeed, better transportation methods were in need, and that is where another solution
        came in place - morticians. In some places, state or county authorities decided that it
        was too problematic and chaotic for people to call police or
        firefighters on those occasions. The perfect solution was to call a funeral house and
        transport living people in need of medical help in a hearse. As much as it sounds like
        a literal joke, it was not, and the sheriff's office in one of the
        districts commented that at least that was a better car to lay people down. In case
        the condition was fatal, at least the right services were already there.</br></br>

        There was urgency for specific service providers. People who would be able to get
        to the patient fast, stabilize, and transport them to the hospital without further
        risking their lives. Moreover, nowhere was that need more apparent than in
        the low-income Hill district, where the white police force was slow to respond and
        met with a general lack of trust in police. The community was reluctant to call in. </br></br>

        It affected Pittsburg, but the issue was recognized and addressed in a 1966 White
        Paper addressed to the government and pointed out that 50 thousand people die on
        American highways every year. Although combat medics experienced in a scene
        emergency medicine were willing to work on solutions, nothing was done.</br></br>
      </p>
      <h2>"A person is more likely to die of a gunshot wound in America than on a battlefield
        in Vietnam."</h2>
      <p>
        The problem affected the black people disproportionately more than the other Pittsburgh
        districts, and Philip Hallen, a community organizer, has fast realized it. He ran a civil
         rights organization called the Maurice Falk Medical Fund, which
        challenged institutional racism in a medical organization. That made him note the issues
        with making him look at emergency services. He approached the Freedom House organization,
        which provided fresh grocery delivery service in the Hill area.
        That made him realize that the organization's trucks could help transport patients from
        that area to the nearest hospital. The system was already there; what it needed was maybe
        more trucks and drivers employed from within the community.
        </br></br>

        Under Hallen's persuasion, Dr Peter Safar, the head of anesthesiology at the University
         of Pittsburgh, joined the new project. He did so with much devotion because he already
         preached the importance of immediate help at the side.
        Nevertheless, without much effect till then, because the medical community had a negative
        opinion on how much a bystander without extensive medical training would help the patient.
         Nevertheless, doctor Safar enthusiastically took care of
        preparing a course program that would train the drivers. </br></br>

        The entire organization was an example of how the local government did not meet the
        infrastructural needs and ignored its obligation towards African American citizens.
        Because of that, they organized themselves and decided to satisfy them on
        their own. It is still a terrifying concept to think that has been their reality.
        Although they became citizens of the same importance to people responsible for
        modernization and safety, they remained irrelevant. That also amplifies how they
        were deemed unimportant; in political games, they received no attention.</br></br>

        There was a group of men assembled and branded with the name Paramedics. A profession
        that changed the face of emergency medicine and brought it to where it is now. All of
        those Paramedics in the city of Pittsburg were black men. The same
        ones were called "unemployable" before they were given a career that made them proud. </br></br>

        In 1970 at Freedom House, an Ambulance Service started. The organization claims to be
        the first of its kind in the world. Not long after starting operation, it became an
        immediate success in its community. Finally, people living in the Hill
        district were not scared to call in for help and could receive it on time. </br></br>

        After operating for a few months with such success, the Ambulance Service got more
        volunteers to become paramedics, making it possible to operate on a bigger scale. They
        started helping people outside of the initial area and soon could cover
        almost the entire Pittsburgh city. That did not occur without particular difficulties.
        First of all, the white population was much suspicious of the new black-only taskforce.
        Some people refused and informed that they would rather wait for
        the police or morticians to arrive. The Ambulance Service gained in the public eyes
        after a few accidents in which they confidently and professionally helped victims and
        assisted them safely to the hospital. </br></br>

        The second difficulty in operating was that nobody from white neighbourhoods would
        call the service first, and police refused to share the incoming calls for help.
        Paramedics installed radios in their ambulances that would pick up police
        frequencies and infiltrate the channels to know where they were needed.</br></br>

        The sad part of that fantastic story is that the problem created by the state and city
         governments' incompetence and systematic racism had to be solved by the community's
         force. In the ideal world, the power party would thank the volunteers
        and originators and hold them in high regard while increasing the budget and supporting
        this beautiful organization's widening scope. However, that would have been
        "too beautiful to be true."</br></br>

        Most possibly, that is why the local government overtook the Paramedics program. All
        of the original paramedics were fired. The procedures and courses were copied, and
        white men were trained to do the same jobs as their predecessors of
        colour. That new ambulance service organization also claimed the cars and available
        equipment.</br></br>

        The African American community of the city of Pittsburgh became marginalized and
        remained without professional help. That enraged the community that had to scramble
        to establish the service in the first place. When it became vital for
        Pittsburgh citizens of any, it became a valuable political asset to be claimed. </br></br>

      <h1>CHAPTER II</h1>

      <h2>
        "Looking straight down from a height of several hundred meters, incredible scenes
        of inequality emerge."
      </h2>
      <h2>
        "If you're considering visiting one of the world's best cities that has an interesting
        history to explore, think no further than Cape Town, situated at the tip of Africa.
        Popularly known as the "Mother City," the city has some of South
        Africa's most important history and culture. The city's beauty is complemented by Table
        Mountain, which sits majestically in the background."
      </h2>
      <p>The quote above is an introduction to a South African government website to promote
        its country. It is painting a fairytale-like destination's image targeted towards
        western tourists. The focus point is the country's cultural richness, which
        might be connected to the visitors' ancestors. However, that is only because they could
        be the ones that colonized the land hundreds of years ago. </br></br>

        Following Instagram accounts, youtube videos, and websites sponsored by the Department
        of Tourism of the Republic of South Africa, one can only wonder how thrilling it has to
        be. Visit the Kruger National Park and observe the lions, hike the
        Drakensberg Mountains with their Golden Gate Highlands National Park 2200 meters above
         sea level. For the less fit top of Table Mountain can be reached by cableway. From there,
          one can wonder over the incredible view of the city below - Cape
        Town. </br></br>

        It is recommended to take a good look and take some pictures - excellent that from
        such a high one cannot see too many details. Then learning about the city's history -
         nowhere better to do so than the Iziko Slave Lodge - a museum established
        especially to explain the city's complicated slave trade origin. Another checkpoint
        is Robben Island, where one will hear about how Nelson Mandela had a dream.</br></br>

        All of that with nothing but honest smiles from one's tour guide that parting with is
         not an option. Taking selfies, enjoying food, #lovesouthafrica, and so on are expected
          from every tourist. Staying near trip stuff and not leaving the hotel
        district is too.</br></br>

        Suppose any tourists wonder why they will hear about dangerous parts of the city, crime,
         kidnappings, and high crime levels in certain parts of the city. No one denies that cities
          as big as Cape Town have their dark and darker alleys. That is
        true for most of them. However, sometimes one should wonder if the forbidden parts are not
         prescribed for a different reason. Maybe they would destroy the subtle image of the
          Rainbow Nation? Bring to its knees the liberal democratic facade
        built for more than 25 years? Expose exterior propaganda of multicultural and multiracial
        peaceful enclaves degenerating Nelson Mandela's dream?</br></br>
      </p>
      <h2>"Each of us is as intimately attached to the soil of this beautiful country as are the
         famous jacaranda trees of Pretoria and the mimosa trees of the bushveld – a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world."
      </h2>
      <p>To understand the conflicts dividing the South African population, we need to dive into
        the county's history. Nevertheless, not done as on Wikipedia where - at least on the
        English site "South Africa" one can read a lot about its discovery
        by white men rather than pointing out that native tribes were inhabiting the land for
        centuries before. Most of what is written in the West history books focuses on the struggle in search of a route to India and how the Dutch settled there
        and then fought the British for it. Some of them will brush over the slave trade,
        which is what made Cape Town and other cities of the region so "culturally rich."
        The Dutch East India Company, the first megacorporation in history, should
        take most of the credit.</br></br>

        Effects of that were significantly felt even hundreds of years later, in 1949 when
        together with the first apartheid law, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, a new
        dark era for South Africa has started. This act and the following ones
        made it legally and practically impossible for black and white citizens to marry or
        live together and use the same facilities. As one could already realize, it was
        "in favor" of the white population having broad access to all public services.
        </br></br>

        Next year the population got classified as specimens in a botanical journal into "white,"
         "black," "coloured," and "indian." Policies effectively segregating people in folders
         of ministries bureau and "shelving" them to certain cities'
        districts were a follow-up. The same happened all around the country but had the most
        dramatic effects in Pretoria and Cape Town.</br></br>

        Trevor Noah, a South Africa comedian growing up during that time in Johannesburg - South
        Africa's biggest city, described his experience in a book called "Born a Crime." He was
        born in 1984, and through the last years of apartheid, he vividly
        experienced its reality. He was born to a white father and black mother whom he lived
        with.</br></br>

        The family could not have anything in the shape of what would be now considered a normal
        relation. As born mixed-race, or as it was called at that time in South Africa, "coloured"
         meant they could never live together in one house. Mr Noah
        considers himself lucky because his mother managed to hide him away from the police, and
        he was not taken away as it was a common practice reinforced by apartheid law. </br></br>

        If it happened otherwise, he would be moved to a different district. One for the
        population of the same appearance as his own and placed in an orphanage. Segregation was
         based only on appearance. Mixing of races was unlawful therefore
        augmented by the Infrastructure of the city. Separate buses or even separate sides of
        the streets segregated by race were a reality for South Africans.</br></br>

        The situation continued legally till the 1990's when by the historians of Rainbow Nation,
         the apartheid ended. However, in reality, it pretty much continues, and it is evident in
         the pictures by Johnny Miller. "Unequal Scenes" is his
        photographic project that depicts the inequality from the title by drone footage of cities
         worldwide, but it significantly started in South Africa.</br></br>

        This cover and story illustrated by it shocked people in the USA and Europe. Many believed

         country full of people that strive for equality.</br></br>

        legally fight to remain where they are.</br></br>

        Here the division is even more visible when one follows the route that we see dividing
        the two areas. On Google maps, there is no way to access the housing estate's internal
        streets on the left by any road connected to the settlement on the
        right.</br></br>

        As professor AB Atkinson discussed in his book "Inequality: What can be done?" we observe
        the population's wealth difference on many levels. The contrast in opportunity is not only
         based on linear thinking - income. As is the case in South
        Africa, Cape Town, the same situation is duplicated in many, if not all, world metropolises.
        The segregation might be caused by different factors - racism, religious differences, urban
        planning - but it has the same results - low or no
        opportunity access.</br></br>

        Lack of basic structures causes the "black, coloured and indian" populations to have fewer
        chances of obtaining education or more lucrative jobs. It starts from a very young age and
        effectively stops the development of the community. Children
        from the segregated districts have access to only a few schools, so no matter if there could
        be a better one to go to if even affording the fare is too much for a gifted child's parents.</br></br>

        For many inhabitants of slums, getting a well-paying job might not be conditioned by their
        abilities or qualifications, which might have been very hard to obtain by being limited to a
        small area. The deciding factor might be the capacity to
        get to it in time from their home. A solution to that would be to move closer to the workplace,
         but social norms bound citizens to live in the race divided districts established decades before.
          If one can free themselves from that, it is only
        through substantial means that are unobtainable for most of the slum's population for reasons
        numbered in this paragraph - the circle is closed - before by apartheid law now inequality of
        opportunity deepening economic rift.</br></br>

        In light of that, it is hard to comprehend how the South African government or any other recognizing
        it can say with full faith that apartheid finished a long time ago. The situation reminds one about
        the word "acquired" on most British
        Museum exponents - one sees it but does not acknowledge it.</br></br>

      <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
      <h2>“At this point in history, this has to be a global struggle, predominantly with finance capital,
        for that is the scale at which urbanisation processes now work. To be sure, the political task of
        organising such a confrontation is difficult,
        if not daunting. However, the opportunities are multiple because, as this brief history shows, crises
        repeatedly erupt around urbanisation both locally and globally, and because the metropolis is now
        the point of massive collision – dare we
        call it class struggle? – over the accumulation by dispossession visited upon the least well-off and
        the developmental drive that seeks to colonise space for the affluent.”</h2>
      <p>In the introduction, I attempted to present a broader idea of how structural framework deficiencies
         embody opportunity inequality. I hope that the examples I provided present few but different ways in
         which insufficient Infrastructure does
        indeed shape our lives. </br></br>

        It is hard to reflect upon it and not be in opposition because some communities or specific demographics
        are mistreated. The problem is very complex, and it is not a solution to blame it only on one aspect.
        As mentioned before, to improve,
        there has to be action taken on many levels, and as the Freedom House Ambulance Service has shown, it
        is not always the best to trust it entirely to the government.</br></br>
        However, as it is in its duties, one might argue that the government should be striving to better its
        citizens' conditions, and every democratic entity should endeavour to improve the unfair situation.
        The most important part of it or the
        first step should be to recognize needs and research what would be the best way to meet them rather
        than searching for one that will give the best press.</br></br>

        A teenage girl who lived in Hokkaido, the most northern tip of Japan, had commuted to school every day.
        Her train station was deemed unprofitable by the rails optimization team. Without a train she could not
        continue her education. The
        Japanese Railways empathically waited with closing the stop until she graduated. It is unclear if that
        story is true or how much of it is.</br></br>

        I broke the rule of not bringing something new into a conclusion in order to finish with a story that
         brings hope and inspiration while looking for the solution. The governments are the only entities with
         enough power to become deus ex
        machina in current infrastructural struggles. I hope that, for whatever reasons, they will want to
        take that role soon.</br></br>
